# compression-paddle
This paddle is a handheld external compression device to facilitate computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous interventions in the abdomen. The device was designed by modifying an existing gastrointestinal fluoroscopy compression device using CAD software. The device was 3d-printed and clinically tested.  

A .stl file is made available <a href="https://ahmedhosny.github.io/compression-paddle/" target="_blank">here</a> for download.

Not for clinical use.
