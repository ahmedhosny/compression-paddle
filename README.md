# compression-paddle
This paddle is a handheld external compression device to facilitate computed tomography (CT)-fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous interventions in the abdomen. The device was designed by modifying an existing gastrointestinal fluoroscopy compression device using CAD software. The device was 3d-printed and clinically tested.
